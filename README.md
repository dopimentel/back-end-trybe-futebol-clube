#### Dockerization

This project utilizes Docker for containerization, including the Dockerization of apps, network, volume, and compose.

#### Data Modeling

Data modeling is achieved using MySQL in conjunction with Sequelize. This involves the creation and association of tables using Sequelize models.

#### API RESTful Development

The project involves the construction of a RESTful API with endpoints to consume the models created during data modeling.

#### CRUD with TypeScript

A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality is implemented using TypeScript, with the support of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for efficient data manipulation.

#### SOLID Principles

The project follows the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to promote maintainability, scalability, and readability in the codebase.

#### Layered Architecture

The project adopts a layered architecture, organizing code into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to enhance modularity, flexibility, and maintainability (Controller, Service and Model).


This project is dockerized and uses data modeling through Sequelize. The API is consumed by a pre-provided front-end.
